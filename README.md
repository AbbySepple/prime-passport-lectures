# Express/Passport Lecture Starting File
Download and run 'npm install' before the lecture as prep. In this lecture, we will build out a user registration page and allow our users to log into our application. Once they are logged in, we will see information returned to us, specific to the user.

##Branches
* `master`: Original lecture code with jQuery, alt static file serving, Grunt, Mongoose/Mongo
* `angular-complete`: Angular and MongoDB version as shown to Iota cohort.
* `sql_strategy`: Replaces MongoDB with PostGRES for storage of user data. Maintains bcrypt functionality.
* `angular-controlled-login-intro`: Introduces Angular as the login handler. All server communication is handled in an Angular Controller and updates the route/page based on success or failure. Intended for an alternate intro lecture to Passport (as seen in angular-complete and sql_strategy).
